    "## Overview\n",
    "PyMuPDF supports the 2-dimensional geometry objects as defined in MuPDF, resp. PDF specifications. Geometry objects are `Point`, `IRect`, `Rect`, `Quad` and `Matrix`. They all represent more or less what their names suggest them to be: they pertain to objects in plane geometry, mostly according to the requirements and terminology of PDF specification.\n",
    "* A `Point` is represented by a pair of floats: `fitz.Point(x, y)`. In PyMuPDF they can be treated as 2-dimensional vectors, including component-wise **_addition_** and **_multiplication_** by numbers and matrices.\n",
    "* `Rect` and `IRect` are specialized subsets of general rectangles: their edges always are parallel to the x- and the y-axis. While a `Rect` may be defined by float numbers, an `IRect` has integer coordinates. Further classifications include **_valid_**, **_empty_** or **_infinite_**, which imply certain behaviors and possibilities. Like points, rectangles can also be **_added_** to each other and can be **_multiplied_** by numbers and matrices. Because of their their special make-up, rectangles can be defined by just 2 points (or correspondingly 4 floats), that are diagonally opposite. By convention, (Py-) MuPDF uses the top-left and the bottom-right points (in **_this_** sequence) for this: `fitz.Rect(x0, y0, x1, y1)`. Using a different sequence, or the other two points leads to **_invalid_** rectangles.\n",
    "* A `Quad` is a quadrilateral or tetragon. It is defined by its 4 corner points **_in the mandatory sequence_** upper-left (**ul**), upper-right (**ur**), lower-left (**ll**), lower-right (**lr**). Quads are much less frequently used than rectangles, but they do play an important role, e.g. for non-horizontal text.\n",
    "* A `Matrix` represents a mapping (or \"transformation\") within objects of any of the above classes. Every geometry object above has method ``transform()``: `OBJ.transform(matrix)` maps OBJ (one of `Point`, `Rect`, `IRect`, `Quad`) to a new object of the same type, which then replaces OBJ. Matrices also support component-wise addition and mutiplication with each other via matrix method ``concat()``. A matrix is represented by 6 floats `fitz.Matrix(a, b, c, d, e, f)` arranged in a special structure of a row-major 3 x 3 matrix:\n",
    "```\n",
    "    / a b 0 \\\n",
    "    | c d 0 |\n",
    "    \\ e f 1 /\n",
    "```\n",
    "* The above objects are implemented as Python sequences, which makes it possible to access and modify their components also via index.\n",
    "* The better part of functions and methods however **_only needs the underlying sequence_** of geometry objects. PyMuPDF therefore defines the notions \"point-like\", \"rect-like\", \"quad-like\" and \"matrix-like\" to indicate that a numerical sequence (tuple, list, array, ndarray ...) with the right length is sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algebraic Operations\n",
    "PyMuPDF defines unary and binary operators that allow handling geometry objects comfortably and intuitively."

    "### Unary Operators\n",
    "PyMuPDF defines a number of unary operators, i.e. involving only one geometry object. The result always is either a bool, a float, or a new object of the same type as the operand.\n",
    "* `abs()` - *(float)* the Euclidean norm for `Point` and `Matrix`, and the area of `Rect` and `IRect` rectangles. For a `Quad` the product of its width and height.\n",
    "* `norm()` - *(float)* the Euclidean norm.\n",
    "* `bool()` - *(bool)* is `False` exactly if all components are zero.\n",
    "* `hash()` - implemented as `hash(tuple(OBJ))`.\n",
    "* `~m` - *(`Matrix`)* the inverse of matrix m. If not invertible, the matrix with all zeroes is returned.\n",
    "* `+OBJ`, `-OBJ` - copy of the original. Negated components if `\"-\"` is used."

    "#### Addition, Subtraction\n",
    "Use `+` and `-` to add / subtract objects of the **_same_** class. This works component-wise. The second operand must be **_like_** the first one - i.e. just a numerical sequence. The second operand may also be just a number, if all components should be modified with the same value. The result is always a **_new object._** The following example equalities apply analogously also to `Rect`, `IRect`, `Quad` and `Matrix` objects:"
